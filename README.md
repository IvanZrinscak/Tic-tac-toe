A generalization of the famous Tic-tac-toe game on a n^d field.

## Web interface

The browser interface lets you choose a 3x3 game in either two or three dimensions.
Three-dimensional games render as a cube that you can rotate with on-page sliders.
Install Flask and run:

```
pip install Flask
python web_app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser, pick the dimension, and play the game.

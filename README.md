# Tic-tac-toe
A generalization of the famous Tic-tac-toe game on a n^d field.

## Web interface

The browser interface lets you choose a 3x3 game in either two or three dimensions.
Three-dimensional games now display as a transparent cube with 3D X and O markers that you can rotate by dragging with the mouse.
Install Flask and run:

```
pip install Flask
python web_app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser, pick the dimension, and play the game.
